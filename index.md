## About Me

I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at [<span class="text-accent">School of Mathematical Sciences</span>](http://english.math.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [<span class="text-accent">Peking University</span>](https://english.pku.edu.cn). Seeking PhD in 26Fall!

## Research Interests
My research focuses on scientific machine learning, aiming to integrate data-driven methods with mathematical and physical principles. In particular, I am interested in operator learning approaches in infinite-dimensional function spaces, with applications such as solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and inverse problems. I'm also deeply interested in the out-of-distribution behavior and generalization of ML models, especially when dealing with complex and variable geometries.
